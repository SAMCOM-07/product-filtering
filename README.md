# product-filtering

This project is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

How it works:

Products can be search and filtered using the buttons. product can be added to or removed from the cart while the quantity can be increased or decreased using the appropriate button.

All cart items are being stored in the local Storage whereby saving changes that are made to cart and displaying them even when the browser is refreshed or restarted.

All products are saved in a JSON file, whereby giving chance to add or remove products without altering the design.
